# ☁️ AWS Solutions Architect Associate Portfolio

Hi, I’m **Waleed Shahab** — a passionate Cloud Enthusiast on a journey to master AWS.  
This portfolio showcases **10 real-world AWS projects** I’ve built while preparing for the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA)** certification.  
Each project is fully hands-on — designed, deployed, and documented step-by-step.
